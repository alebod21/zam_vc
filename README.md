# Zam VC
Zam VC is a WebRTC powered video conferencing platform. It was designed with an "IO" feel to make 
video conferencing on the web as seamless as possible, and uses easy to remember 5 digit room IDs 
to allow users to speak with one another in rooms. Currently, Zam supports up to 4 people per room
and dynamically scales each peer's video in a grid. 

So the real quesiton is - what are you waiting for!
